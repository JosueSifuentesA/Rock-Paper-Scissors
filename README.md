# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, built with React. The game allows the user to select one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) to play against the computer, and displays the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw) based on the standard game rules.

In addition, the game includes a button to display the game rules, and the user's score is persisted across page refreshes using browser local storage.

# Usage
To play the game, simply select one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and click the "Play" button. The computer will randomly choose its option, and the outcome of the game will be displayed on the screen.

To view the game rules, click the "Rules" button.

The user's score is displayed at the top of the screen, and will persist across page refreshes. To reset the score, simply clear the local storage for the page.
